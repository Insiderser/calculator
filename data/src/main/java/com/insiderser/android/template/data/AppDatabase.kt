/**
 * A main Room database. Here you can retrieve all app DAOs.
 *
 * You don't need to use this class directly. Instead, get one of DAOs using Dagger.
 *
 * In big projects, it's preferable to create separate database classes for each
 * feature/module. That's because if you have one DB for the whole app,
 * it won't scale very well and has no isolation. On the other hand,
 * with feature-based DBs you create separate DBs for each feature,
 * which scales very well and has perfect isolation, but it costs more because
 * maintaining DB connections is expensive, and your DBs can't share data between
 * each other. You can go hybrid, merging dependent databases together and
 * keeping separate DBs in isolation. Also, Google says that they are working
 * on making Room merge dependent DBs at runtime, but it's not available yet.
